# Good Food Good Mood
## Introduction
Welcome to Good Food Good Mood! This is a full stack web application built with 
React and Flask. It was based on a first-world dilemma that I encounter 
frequently, which is "what the heck do I wanna eat for dinner?" I was sick and 
tired of eating the same things constantly, so I thought how could I solve this 
issue. Therefore Good Food Good Mood came to life.

## Technologies
This project is created with:

* CSS
* HTML
* MaterialUI
* JavaScript ES6
* Python
* TypeScript

## Features
Users are able to search through thousands of recipes all in one place via 
different search criteria including ingredient(s), cuisine, diet restrictions, 
and/or total cook time. Authenticated users can save/update their favorite 
recipes to a dashboard or upload recipes of their own to create their own online 
digital cookbook.

## Future Plans
Some features that I hope to incorporate in the future include: unit conversions, 
serving size conversions, editing/deleting recipes from the main dashboard.
